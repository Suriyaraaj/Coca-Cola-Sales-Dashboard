In my Excel dashboard project on Coca-Cola sales (2022-2023), the dataset includes detailed monthly sales figures, revenue, and regional performance metrics. 

It covers product categories and customer segments, providing a comprehensive view of sales data. 

This dataset supports the creation of pivot tables, charts, and KPIs, enabling thorough analysis and dynamic visualizations to effectively track Coca-Cola's sales performance over the two-year period.
